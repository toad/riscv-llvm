Note that these tests check both the built-in memcpy/memmove for LLVM, and
also newlib code.

Memcpy: Tests non-overlapping memcpy and memmove with tags.
MemmoveOverlap: Tests a single special memmove with tags and overlap.
- Note that the mem* tests are not intended to exhaustively test memcpy/memmove! There are tests in newlib for that.
