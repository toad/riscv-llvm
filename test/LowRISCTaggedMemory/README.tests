Tests for tagged memory-based code pointer protection
-----------------------------------------------------

Note that these tests check both the built-in memcpy/memmove for LLVM, and
also newlib code.

Memcpy: Tests non-overlapping memcpy and memmove with tags.
MemmoveOverlap: Tests a single special memmove with tags and overlap.
- Note that the mem* tests are not intended to exhaustively test memcpy/memmove! There are tests in newlib for that.

StackProtection: Tests LLVM code to protect spilled variables including return address.

VPtrTagging: Tests protection of C++ virtual pointers.
